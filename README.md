# Aperiodic_sleep

This project investigates the temporal aspects of aperiodic activity during sleep. 
Aperiodic activity provides an alternative way to look at the elctrophysiological signal. The spectral exponent for instance has been shown to reflect Excitation-inhibition ration in underlying cortical circuits. In sleep, it has been show to change as a function of chaging the stage of sleep with the steepest slope observed during deep sleep. 

In this project, we provide general methodoligcal guidlines and consideration for investigating aperiodic activity, and explore the temporal dynamics of aperiodic activity during sleep.

The project repo consists of 4 main folder:

1) Notebooks: containing all notebooks used in the analysis

2) Scripts: the scripts that need high processing speeed to run. Read full night hd EEG files and run analysis.

3)Helpers: custom made helper functions and scripts that are used in our analyses

4) iEEG: scripts for analysisng open source iEEG data.

# Overview

The investigation of aperiodic activity in electrophysiological signals is trending. Previous work showed that the aperiodic exponent cna differentiate between stages.
In this project, we used recent methods for parametrizing neural power spectra  (Donoghue et al., 2020) in iEEG and EEG sleep recordings to investigate the temporal dynamics of aperiodic activity during sleep.

This project was completed between Jacob's Lab at Columbia University in NYC, USA abd the Sleep Lab at University of Salzburg in Slazburg, Austria
